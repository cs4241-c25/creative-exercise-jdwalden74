## James Walden Creative Exercise: SVG animations and canvas shapes
- Link: https://creative-project-jdwalden74.glitch.me/
- I did an SVG example utilizing canvas featuring a rectangle which can move and change size as well as has a gradient 
- and a circle animation below it.
- My code is based on a couple different examples from the svg website including the circle animation and gradient for
- the rectangle. I changed a couple of the values around to make it my own.
